# Cults cults cults

You’ve somehow accepted an incredibly weird project to design a website for cults. They want to be able to easily sign up followers, create new blood oaths with them, and increase membership. Some of the files have been provided for you — the rest of the spooky work is up to you.

## Things to consider:
- There can be many followers in a cult
- A blood oath is between a cult and a follower

## Deliverables:
* Followers
  * A follower has a name and age
  * New followers can be instantiated
  * Follower can join only one cult 
  * Follower CANNOT LEAVE A CULT
  * A follower's age cannot be under 18 

* Cults
  * A cult has a name and slogan
  * Cult can be created
  * Cult can change name and slogan
  * Cult's slogan must be unique
  * Cult's slogan cannot be over 200 characters
